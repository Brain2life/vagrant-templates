## Lab environment setup:  
![](./img/jenkins-lab.png)

## Overview:
0. Tested on host machine: Ubuntu 20.04, Vagrant 2.3.0, VirtualBox 6.1.34r150636
1. Ansible control node: CentOS7, IP: `192.168.56.10`, hostname: `control`
2. Worker nodes: CentOS7, IP: `192.168.56.11-[12]`, hostname: `worker1-[2]` 
3. Configuration of the Nodes is done via bash scripts in `provision` folder
4. [CentOS7 box](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/7)
5. All three nodes in private network `192.168.56.1/21` with access to the Internet via NAT

## Usage:
1. Deploy the environment:
```shell
vagrant up
```
To check the deployment of VMs use:
```shell
vagrant global-status --prune
```
2. To SSH into VM:
```shell
vagrant ssh [vm_name]
```
3. To gracefully stop VMs use:
```shell
vagrant halt
```
4. To delete environment:
```shell
vagrant destroy
```
For more info check the following article: [Quick startup with Vagrant](https://brain2life.hashnode.dev/quick-startup-with-vagrant)

## VM machine resource configuration:
1. VM configuration is done with `v.customize` option
2. VMs use 2GB and 2CPU

## Test connectivity to worker nodes:
To test connectivity from control node to your worker node, in `ansible` folder on control node run:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m ping
```
Enter password `vagrant`. Should return `SUCCESS` message

## Ad-hoc Ansible commands:
1. To show all setup info about the servers use:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m setup
```
2. To run shell command on remote servers use `shell` module:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m shell -a "uptime"
```
3. To run command (not via shell, won't see env variables):
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m command -a "ls /var"
```
For security reasons it is better to use `command` module. See [What is the Difference Between Shell and Command in Ansible?](https://linuxhint.com/shell-vs-command-modules-ansible/)
4. To copy file from control node to all worker node use:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m copy -a "src=[path_to_the_file] dest=[path_where_to_put_copy] mode=[chmod_number]" -b
```
`-b` - option allows you to run the command with sudo privileges
5. To delete file use `file` module:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m file -a "path=[path_to_the_file] state=absent" -b
```
6. How to download to all worker nodes from the Internet:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m get_url -a "url=https://[path_to_the_file] dest=[path_where_to_copy]" -b
```
7. To install programs on CentOS use `yum` module (to remove use `removed` state):
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m yum -a "name=[program_name] state=installed" -b
```
8. To make `curl` like command in Ansible use `uri` module:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m uri -a "url=http://[path]"
```
to return the content add `return content=yes`
9. Example of installing and enabling `httpd` on all worker nodes:
Intalling:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest" -b
```
Enabling:
```shell
ansible -i hosts.txt all --ask-pass -m service -a "name=httpd state=started enabled=yes" -b
```
10. To debug use `-vvv` or `-vvvv` option for your Ansible commands
11. To see all modules available in the Ansible use:
```shell
ansible-doc -l
```
